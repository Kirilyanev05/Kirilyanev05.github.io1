    <h1>My study choice</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
         Choosing a field of study was probably one of the hardest desicions in my life.
         I went from studying Law to Psycology, Programming and then back to Law.
         I couldn't make my mind what I should study and I was ready to give up.
         But thanks to my family and friends I managed to put my mind together and probably made the best desicion of my life.
         I chose ICT. My family helped me realise that is really for me. Not only, because I like computers and games but also
         because this is what I am good at.
         Also I am really optimistic about my future, because I know that with the knowledge and skills that I will gain in ICT,
         I will be able to make a career in this field of work.
