   <h1>My SWOT analysis</h1> 
   <article>
    A SWOT analysis is a powerful tool for self-reflection and I am glad that this course gave me the opportunity
    to do one myself.
    I would first like to start with my strengths. Even though I am still very young and have much to learn,
    I can confidently say that I have quite a few strengths. One of them is my adaptability. I can safely say that 
    since I arrived in The Netherlands I have adapted quite well in this new environment for me. Also this will 
    help me in the field of ICT because this is a crucial skill in this field.
    Lets move on to my weaknesses. I am a human after all and no one can be perfect.
    Probably my greatest wekness is my tendency to procrastinate. This has always been an issue of mine
    and even though I am working on it and have improved, I still suffer from it.
    Looking forward in the future there are several opportunities for growth and advancments.
    This is also one of the reason why I chose ICT, because this field is rapidly expanding everyday, which unlocks a lot of opportunities.
    If you know what you are doing of cource.
    Lastly, this article could not be completed without mentioning the threats I need to navigate.
    One such threat is the fast-paced nature of ICT. One could easily lose track of things and fall behind.
    People in this field of work should always stay updated on the latest developments.
