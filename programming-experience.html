    <h1>My programming experience</h1>
    <article>
        Even though i never attended a school that specializes in programming and computers, that didn't stop me from 
        being curios about this topic. I have completed a few courses about programming before.
        It was a university in Bulgaria which you could sign for a programming course with a language of your choice.
        I chose c# and completed the basics training. I learned to solve simple mathematical equations with c#.
